Hi, my name is Gabriel Garcia and I'm a programmer.

This website is my personal space to share my favorite hobby: programming. From
personal projects and deep dives into languages to quirky experiments and
practical tips, I hope my blog inspires, teaches, or entertains other
programmers who share the same curiosity for code.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing the piano, rock climbing, and cooking.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Garciat),
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/garciat.climbs/) (rock climbing),
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/garciat/) (not active), and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggarciat/).
